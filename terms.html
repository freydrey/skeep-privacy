      <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
      <div class="meta">
        For <strong>Skeep</strong> (the “App”)<br/>
        Effective date: <strong>February 2, 2026</strong>
      </div>
    </header>

    <div class="card">
      <p>
        These Terms & Conditions (“Terms”) govern your use of Skeep. By installing or using the App,
        you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, please do not use the App.
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        Skeep is an accessibility utility that helps users automate taps on repetitive UI prompts
        (for example “Skip Ad”, “Next”), based on button texts you configure.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>1) Who we are</h2>
    <p>
      “We”, “us”, and “Skeep” refer to the developer/publisher of the App. “You” refers to the user
      of the App.
    </p>

    <h2>2) What Skeep does (and does not do)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Automation tool:</strong> The App can use Android’s Accessibility Service to detect on-screen UI elements and perform taps on your behalf.</li>
      <li><strong>User-controlled:</strong> You choose which apps to target and which button texts to tap.</li>
      <li><strong>No affiliation:</strong> Skeep is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by YouTube/Google or any third-party app you use.</li>
      <li><strong>No guaranteed results:</strong> Third-party apps can change their UI at any time, which may reduce effectiveness or cause unintended taps if configured broadly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3) Accessibility permission & your responsibilities</h2>
    <p>
      To function, Skeep may require Accessibility permission. When enabled, the App can read basic UI structure
      and perform taps to automate actions you configure.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>You are responsible for enabling/disabling Accessibility permission.</li>
      <li>You are responsible for choosing safe and specific target words (for example <code>Skip Ad</code> instead of broad terms like <code>Skip</code> or <code>Next</code>).</li>
      <li>You agree not to use the App for illegal purposes, harmful activity, or to violate any third-party terms you have agreed to.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4) Safety & intended use</h2>
    <p>
      Skeep is designed to reduce repetitive tapping. Because UI automation can interact with third-party apps,
      you should use cautious configurations and review your selected apps and words regularly.
    </p>

    <h2>5) Purchases, verification & restoring access</h2>
    <p>
      Skeep may offer an optional one-time purchase to unlock premium/unlimited use (“Unlock”).
      Purchases are processed by Google Play Billing.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Verification:</strong> To confirm an Unlock and enable restore on reinstall/device reset, the App may send a Google Play purchase token (and a device identifier such as Android ID) to our server for validation.</li>
      <li><strong>What we do NOT receive:</strong> We do not receive your payment card details.</li>
      <li><strong>Restore:</strong> If you reinstall the App or change devices, you may use the “Restore purchases” option (where available) to regain access.</li>
      <li><strong>Refunds:</strong> Refunds are handled according to Google Play’s policies and the purchase flow shown in Google Play.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6) Free limits & changes</h2>
    <p>
      The App may include free usage limits or trial behavior. These limits, pricing, and features may change over time
      to improve the App, prevent abuse, or meet platform requirements. Any changes will be reflected in the App or store listing.
    </p>

    <h2>7) Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Our Privacy Policy explains what information we collect and how we use it. Please review it here:
      <a href="REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_PRIVACY_POLICY_URL">Privacy Policy</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>8) Intellectual property</h2>
    <p>
      The App, including its code, designs, and branding, is owned by the developer and protected by applicable laws.
      You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of the App except as allowed by law.
    </p>

    <h2>9) Disclaimers</h2>
    <p>
      The App is provided <strong>“as is”</strong> and <strong>“as available”</strong>, without warranties of any kind.
      We do not guarantee that the App will be error-free, uninterrupted, or compatible with all devices/apps.
      Third-party apps may change their UI, which can affect Skeep’s performance.
    </p>

    <h2>10) Limitation of liability</h2>
    <p>
      To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential,
      or punitive damages, or any loss of data, revenue, profits, or goodwill arising from your use of the App.
      Where liability cannot be excluded, our total liability will be limited to the amount you paid for the Unlock (if any).
    </p>

    <h2>11) Termination</h2>
    <p>
      You may stop using the App at any time. We may suspend or terminate access to features if we reasonably believe
      the App is being used in a way that is abusive, illegal, or harmful, or if required by law or platform policy.
    </p>

    <h2>12) Changes to these Terms</h2>
    <p>
      We may update these Terms occasionally. The effective date at the top will change when updates are made.
      Continued use of the App after updates means you accept the updated Terms.
    </p>
